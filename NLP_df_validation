5068,en_0871983,product_en_0814870,reviewer_en_0045493,1,"Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.",Simply does not work as described,en,electronics

I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.","**DO NOT BUY** This product used to be excellent, but not anymore.

6541,en_0432287,product_en_0333022,reviewer_en_0978470,2,"I have several issues with this endoscope that caused me to return it: 1) There are two laws of civil engineering: F=MA and ""You can't push on a rope."" This device violates rule #2. It isn't nearly rigid enough. I wanted to look above my ceiling to trace the electrical wiring, but I couldn't snake this thing more than about four feet before it started to bend and bunch up. Trying to negotiate it through any sort of rough terrain is maddening when you can't see well and you have no control over the tip. All you can do is push on that rope. Why have a 10 meter scope if you can't use more than four feet of it? You might be able to run it down some kind of conduit or pipe or reinforce the cable with wire to stiffen it, but I don't feel like that should be necessary. 2) Thinking maybe I was using this for the wrong purpose, I tried running it down a drain pipe. I couldn't negotiate the P trap and the camera got covered with gunk so quickly that it wouldn't have mattered if I could. I think the best use for this is to look under your refrigerator or maybe in your gutter downspout. 3) The camera needs some kind of self-leveling mechanism. It's impossible to keep the cable from rotating as you try to maneuver it. You can tell the app to rotate the image 90 degrees at a time, but you can't tell the scope to stay right side up. You're constantly trying to figure out which way is up and what you're looking at. 4) When you add attachments, they block the view of the camera. It's like walking around using only your peripheral vision. It works, but not well. With much effort I successfully retrieved my keys using the magnet and the hook when they were on the floor right in front of me, so there's some theoretical value there. The mirror attachment is simply unusable -- I already said it was hard to use, once you can't see what's in front of you it's impossible. 5) The ""magic claw"" isn't attached to the device at all. It's a completely separate tool, and not very good. Search Amazon for ""flexible grabber"" and you'll see what it is, except it's only 2 feet long including the handle. Worthless. 6) You have to disconnect from your normal WiFi network in order to connect to this device. Not a deal killer, but inconvenient. There are a few things I liked about this device: 1) It's fairly inexpensive 2) The camera is decent 3) The light is good unless it gets covered in gunk 4) I found it fairly easy to connect",Disappointing,en,camera

Certainly they can be used in a wired mode, but that has become less and less convenient. The product fits well and is unobtrusive. It sounds fine. It can be charged without removing it and this is its biggest selling point over competitors. In the material, it says ""Built-in long lasting battery, charging 2 hours for enjoying up to 15 hrs music playtime or talk."" so I thought the battery would be fine. It actually only lasts between 3 and 4 hours. I contacted the seller and they responded: ""Hello, Thanks for your message, this adapter's battery life is about 5 hours, so it is normal to be that.

The only way you can assemble this product is to forcibly bend the heavy duty wire retaining pieces until they slide into the drill holes. Even then, ""slide"" is not the correct word because you have to beat them into place with a rubber mallet: Assuming you are strong enough to do this, once beaten into place the bent- wire retainer pieces will try to spring open; this runs the permanent risk of splitting the wooden shelf into two or more pieces.

I purchased this pillow because I am a back sleeper and I wanted a slight incline and cervical support. I opened package let it completely expand. I then laid down for 15 minutes to see if it would work for me. Short answer is NOPE. It claims to be a very supportive memory foam wedge with support for your neck. They do not say that you need to have a specific length of neck for this pillow to be comfortable. I do not have a long neck, however it isn't that short. This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly. Also the supportive part ends at almost a standard pillow size and then there is a soft floppy pad of light weight and very soft 1"" memory foam. That accounts for half the pillows length. After 5-10 minutes my lower back started to spasm. I will give benefit of the doubt here and add a disclaimer that maybe I happened to get a defective pillow.

One thing that's great is that it holds a lot of cards without bending them as long as you don't try to move the book around in weird ways and what not. But that's about all this does. The book itself just looks like they took 2 x 20 page monster binders and then slapped them together into one binding, so overall its not really great for people who like to admire their cards frequently. Also, the outside material doesn't seem to be as tough as their other binders that are smaller, I wonder if this is because of the stress of having a larger capacity for cards or what, but the material on my particular binder is already starting to tear apart, but like I said, the cards are in good shape and are protected so I guess this binder is technically doing it's job haha. This Binder overall is great for people who buy/sell/trade a lot of their bulk and need something with a large capacity to carry all of their extra cards around, but if you want something that you can admire your cards in, just get the regular 20 page monster binders.","Good for bulk, that's about it.",en,office_product

They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.","Good, and easy enough to use for the price!",en,home_improvement

There are some minor short comings. The case does not offer much in protection as others have mentioned, the bump surrounding the screen is quite small.

However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating.

Unlike some other earbuds I’ve tried, these don’t skip at all. I’ve had no issues with the battery life... I’ve never had them run out while I’m using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It’s slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don’t fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear.

The case would easily fit inside a backpack or briefcase but would be a bit more cumbersome to carry alone.

I thought I'd try this one out and am pleasantly surprised. It's great that this stylus works with all devices old and new. I use this with an older ipad that doesn't support the new pencils.
